# Lattices In Cryptography

These are lecture notes and homeworks from my graduate-level Lattices
in Cryptography seminar course, taught at the University of Michigan
(Fall 2022 and 2015) and previously at Georgia Tech (Fall 2013).

The notes are a work in progress, will be updated irregularly, and may
contain (hopefully minor) errors, typos, etc. Pull requests are
welcome!
